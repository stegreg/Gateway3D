# Gateway3D
Gateway3D is an experimental/toy 3D rendering engine, written in C++ with OpenGL.
The goal of this project is to use it as a base structure to learn basic and advanced topics
in computer graphics.
> [!WARNING]
> Being conceived as 'experimental', it is not meant to be used in production.

Some of the main features, at the current time of writing, are:
- Forward rendering with cluster shading (although light cluster injection still happens on the cpu)
- PBR materials, with customizable shaders.
- Normal mapping and Parallax Occlusion Mapping.
